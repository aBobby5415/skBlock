# skBlock

`📝` SkBlock is a universal script that allows you to block player actions.

`🍵` The script's functionality includes blocking player movement, the ability to send messages to the chat and interact with the world (place and break blocks).

> [!TIP]
> For the script to work, you need to install the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases) plugin version 2.8.3 and higher, as well as [SkBee](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkBee/releases).  Place the .sk file in `plugins/skript/scripts/` and restart the server (or if the plugins are installed, enter the command /skript reload).

`✅` Enjoy using it!
